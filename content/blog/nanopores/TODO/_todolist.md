TODO: 

- Nanopore sequencing - how does it work - Series?

1. electrically
   1. Where does the voltage come from? 
   2. What is being actually measured?
   
2. chemically/enzymatically
   1. What is the actual library made off?
   2. What are Nanopores?
   3. What are motor proteins?
   4. How can motor proteins be *attached*?
   
3. acquisition
   1. (how does calibration work?)
   2. How does pore scanning work? 
   3. How are reads detected? 
   4. And how can they be rejected?
   
4. basecalling
   1. Which steps do the data take? (trimming, normalization)
   2. How does the basecalling work - actually? 
   3. How are Q-Scores calculated?
   4. Is there something else (polishing)?
   
5. subsequent analysis
   1. How does dorado demultiplex?
   2. How does dorado estimate poly A tails?
   3. Medaka sequence polishing
   4. What to do? Isoform assignment

6. Common (imho) Misconceptions
   1. The "Motor" protein isn't actually pushing
   2. How many reads does a pore take? How does that work? (motor protein probably positively charged gets dispelled when nucleic acid leaves) -> implications for PNA and peptides in general
   3. Nanopore Reads vs other reads (what does native single molecule _mean_)
   4. Democratizing sequencing access is **goood**
