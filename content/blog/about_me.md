Hi! I'm Patrick. 

I'm a Scientist studying RNA, viruses, and both at once using some crazy technology where we sequence individual molecules of nucleic acids through pores that are so tiny that the composition and order of atoms that are currently in the pore substantially affect its resistance to ions. 

In my free time I like to 3D print, work on my 3D printer(s) or do other stuff that I may not feel like I have sharable knowledge about (yet).
